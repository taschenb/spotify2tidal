class Spotify2Tidal:
    """Provide a interface for moving from Spotify to Tidal.

    In order to use it, you need a valid Premium-Subscription for Spotify and an
    account at Tidal.
    While Tidal requires just a username and password, Spotify requires some
    work to register a third-party application to access ones account.

    A valid client ID and client secret need to be created and a redirection
    link needs to be whitelisted.
    This can be done in the Spotify developer dashboard by creating a new app.
    This will generate both ID and secret.
    In the app settings, the redirection url can then be whitelisted. If unsure,
    you can use 'http://localhost'.

    To access the 'Discover Weekly' playlist from Spotify, the playlist-ID for
    the 'Discover Weekly' playlists need to be provided. This is necessary
    because this particular playlist is technical not yours, but Spotify's.
    To get the ID, simply go to your 'Discover Weekly' playlist,
    click on the three dots -> Share -> Copy Link. The ID you are looking for is
    then between "https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/" and "?si=".
